# WorkTimeTracker
A simple app for Android devices to track time spent at work.

## File format for saving data
The simplest way for storing and saving work time data would be using CSV file format. An example CSV for
work time tracking would look something like this:

	Year,Month,Day,Start time,Stop time,Time worked,+/-
	2015,01,25,07:00,15:00,8:00,00:00
	
CSV file format would be the most ideal option for storing work data since a great number of spreadsheet softwares
supports CSV format, thus making it easier to compose Excel worksheets for further data handling.
